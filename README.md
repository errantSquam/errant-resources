# Foreword
When it comes to learning art, my focus is on **maintaining motivation**, and not rigorous discipline. I believe that hating the process is detrimental to learning, and information is best absorbed when you're having fun.

I do art as a hobby, but improvement is something I always strive to keep up with. I'll let my [technical skill speak for itself](https://heckingsne.cc/#/gallery).

As with all art resources, this is subject to **my opinion** and what works for me may not work for you. And that's okay! You should approach learning with a critical eye. Form your own opinions and find a process that works for you.

---

## How to utilize these resources
I'm a programmer, so I believe that anyone can do anything with sufficient Googling and determination. 

However, guidelines are helpful, so I've marked each resource with skill level recommendations (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced). **Don't let this deter you** from picking up something you feel is beyond your level!

Most of these resources are marked as Intermediate/Advanced, for good reason. If you're a beginner, you should focus on maintaining your motivation and having fun! But I also detail some useful beginner exercises later in this list :)

---
### Recommendations
**Beginner** - Easily digestible, little to no prior knowledge of art fundamentals required.

**Intermediate** - You or your peers might be happy with how your art looks, and you've mostly escaped the uncanny valley. For when the internet's art tutorials don't quite cut it anymore, but you want to push your skills further.

**Advanced** - You know what you want to work on, and you mostly grind fundamentals now, but adding more resources to your collection doesn't hurt.

---
### Absorbing the Resources
My recommendation on a first, second read is to **skim!** You should **not** be digesting EVERYTHING on the first read, not even the *Beginner* resources.

Skim the readings, pick out one or two key learning points, and hold onto that. Give yourself time to digest and integrate it into your art. 

When drawing, you should still draw in your comfort zone, but **pick one or two things** to push yourself on. You can still draw your usual subjects if you prefer!

Some of these resources (like How to Draw) have their own exercises, and I may also suggest exercises to do alongside other textbooks. I recommend you do **1-2 exercises a day** (*not every day, just whenever you can and feel like it*), and even that will help you see improvement.

---
### The Dreaded Art Block
It's normal to feel stuck. Take a break! Most of us have responsibilities, so it's okay if your break spans anywhere from a week to **years**. 

Be nice to yourself, and you'd be surprised by how much your brain processes knowledge; even if you haven't picked up the pencil in what seems like forever.

It gets easier every time you return to the hobby.

# General Fundamentals

## Drawing

- (FREE) [**Perspective Made Easy** by **Ernest R. Norling**](https://ia801206.us.archive.org/34/items/PerspectiveMadeEasy/Norling%20-%20Perspective%20Made%20Easy.pdf) 
  - Very good introduction to perspective! Super easy to digest.
  - Recommended study: *Need backgrounds to practice on? Try [Random Street View!](https://randomstreetview.com/)*
  - Recommendation: **Beginner, Intermediate**

- (FREE) [**How to Draw** by **Scott Robertson**](https://archive.org/details/how-to-draw-drawing-and-sketching-objects-and-environments-from-your-imagination-pdfdrive.com) 
  - IMO the superior (and less rigid/preachy) alternative to drawabox.com. Can be a little technical at the start but it's worth just doing the exercises once or twice. Very good for learning the logic behind foreshortening. 
  - Recommended study: *Copy the exercises in the first few chapters.*
  - Recommendation: **Intermediate, Advanced**

## Rendering

- (PAID) **Devin Korwin's** **Creative Fundamentals**, [Part 1](https://underpaintacademy.com/product/creative-fundamentals-vol-1-ebook/), [Part 2](https://underpaintacademy.com/product/creative-fundamentals-vol-2-ebook/)
  - Very concise explanations of art fundamentals. Some of the best out there.
  - These can be found on his Twitter (for free) as well, but I prefer to avoid linking to Twitter for various reasons. 
  - Recommended study: *There's a lot you can study from these books, but two-value studies are one of the standout ways you can practice.*
  - Recommendation: **Intermediate, Advanced**

- (FREE) [**Shading Tutorial** by **AndroidArts**](https://androidarts.com/art_tut.htm) 
  - Very useful tutorial for rendering and describing the common pitfalls!
  - Recommendation: **Intermediate, Advanced**

- (FREE) [**James Gurney's Color and Light**](https://ia802907.us.archive.org/28/items/Color_and_Light_James_Gurney_English/Color_and_Light_James_Gurney_English.pdf) 
  - Approachable explanations to color theory, and also goes into traditional methods.
  - The Archive link is free, but I highly recommend getting the book if you can!
  - Recommendation: **Intermediate, Advanced**

- (FREE) [**How to Render** by **Scott Robertson**](https://ia601902.us.archive.org/19/items/Scott_Robertson_How_to_Render/Scott_Robertson_How_to_Render.pdf) - Advanced level, same caveats as How to Draw
  - Recommended study: *Same as How to Draw. Do a few of the exercises every now and then.*
  - Recommendation: **Intermediate, Advanced**

### YouTube Videos
These are also worth a watch, and free! I tend to prefer no-nonsense YouTube videos, because I find that it's saturated with clickbaity and unhelpful art advice these days.

- Any of [James Gurney's landscape painting processes. ](https://www.youtube.com/@JamesGurney) 
  - He explains his process as he paints, which is really helpful.
  - Mostly for traditional medium.
- [Aaron Blaise's Simple Methods for painting Light and Shadow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5ulFxA-eA).
  - Very good beginner introduction to rendering.
- Any of [hungryclicker's speedpaints](https://www.youtube.com/@hungryclicker)
  - Hungry Clicker mostly draws anime humans, but their range is pretty good. Quite a bit of realism in there too, and a variety of human face and body types. Good to analyze, though maybe overwhelming for beginners.

# Other Exercises

## Beginner Exercises

Please Google any technical terms for further reading if you'd like :)

- **Proportions, getting over symbol drawing:** Learn to draw *what you see*, not what you *think you see!* Turn your reference upside down and copy it exactly. Focus on **proportions!** Utilize various landmarks and negative space to get things as precise as possible. You'll be surprised how well things turn out!
  - Landmarks — key areas to indicate proportion. For example, when your arms are resting at the side, your wrists start around the crotch area *(the part of your body where your legs join at the top, for people with English as their second langauge)*.
  - Negative Space - Empty spaces formed by the subject of an image. They can create more interesting and identifiable shapes sometimes.

- **Play with 3D models!** We live in an age where 3D is a thing, and that's beautiful. Chances are, you want to draw your favourite character, and they don't exactly have real life photo references. There are lots of fan-made models on sites like Thingiverse, although my go-to repository for video games is [The Modeler's Resource](https://models.spriters-resource.com/).
  - 3D models give you an instinctive feel for form and volume, and this might be helpful to develop before you dive headfirst into the more advanced resources.

## Speed-Drawing Exercises
A lot of people ask me how I draw fast (I tend to finish lightweight paintings in about 1-2 hours). I used to take about several weeks to finish art, so hope is not lost! It's totally doable. 

Huge caveat before you read the rest, though:
### DRAW AS MUCH AS IS COMFORTABLE. YOU SHOULD NOT BE PUSHING YOURSELF OR FEELING STRAIN.

If you feel strain, **stop.** Pause the timer. Re-evaluate your posture. Adjust your posture until the pain goes away (if it's nerve pain), or if it's just achey, then stop.

Okay, with that out of the way, my recommendation for going fast:

Do speedpaints. Time yourself to 30 minutes to an hour, and finish **everything** — from sketch to **colored** flats to **shading** within that time. 
- It will look bad. That's okay. My first few speedpaints were terrible, too. 

- Take note of what you struggled with, and analyze your bottlenecks! Some common bottlenecks I experience are
  - Not understanding my subject well. Go back to the study mines. You can take your time here; get **pictures** of your subject (or whatever anatomical structure you suck at), analyze them, and copy them closely. Go attempt another speedpaint. Rinse and repeat.

  - Overplanning! Planning is fundamental to art, but just like programming, sometimes you're prematurely optimizing. Counter to the previous point, sometimes you're **too perfectionist**. Let go of your plans a bit and sketch what you need to. You'll be surprised at how much your brain can fill in the blanks when you have the main silhoeutte down. Typically, I find that small details (trims, buttons, feather textures, scales) are actually unnecessary to sketch out and this can be integrated into the rendering phase.

- You should not be spending most of your time achieving your new PB! Take some time to relax and practice. Speedpaints should be the occasional benchmark for your skill level and efficiency. Sometimes the speed also comes with practice, and speedpaints are just to give you more **confidence** in drawing (and therefore speed).

- **Experimentation is key!** While speedpainting, you should use this time to try out different techniques. You're not committed to a finished piece that's necessarily *good*, and you might discover a method that not only works well for you, but works fast.

Do you need to draw fast? No. A lot of artists, even professionals, draw slow. But for me, here are the benefits:
- More practice and experimentation in a short timeframe.

- The dopamine of completing stuff fast helps maintain my motivation; both for starting art pieces, and keeping at the hobby in general.

- Art isn't my full-time job, so it's nice being able to bust out a piece for whatever I feel like drawing without feeling like I don't have enough time in a day.

---

## Nerve Pain
Pain is kind of inevitable for human beings, especially since our bodies haven't evolved to accommodate our sedentary lifestyles yet. So many hobbies make you sit down for long periods of time. Art is one of them.

For art, depending on your posture, there are many places this pain can originate. 

I highly recommend **seeing an actual doctor**, but here's a troubleshooting guide.

---

- Carpal Tunnel - Wrist pain. The most popular artist pain, and there are plenty of resources out there on how to deal with carpal. 
  - I highly recommend not drawing with your wrist, however. Please pivot with your elbow or shoulder instead. If you're doing digital art, an armrest helps. That being said...

- Cubital Tunnel - Elbow pain. It CAN **feel like wrist pain**, but the pain only flares when your elbow is pressed against a surface (kind of like your funny bone!!)
  - Get a proper elbow rest if you're going to pivot with your elbow. 
  - Be careful when researching ergonomic mice for elbow pain! Vertical mice can cause your arm to supinate excessively and that, too, causes nerve pain. Personally for me diagonal ergonomic mice work best, but YMMV.

- Shoulder/Neck pains. Yep. Even if you optimize with a shoulder, weak shoulders cause pain, and it, too, radiates down the rest of the arm. I *highly,* highly recommend working on your core.

---

But this is an art resource guide, so most of us aren't well versed in physical stuff. I do, however, have resources for that too :)

Remember, **see a doctor** if it gets too bad! If these recommendations don't work and make your pain worse, you're probably **stretching the wrong muscles.**

--- 

- For core strength, [12 Minutes of Foundation Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BOTvaRaDjI&list=WL&index=2) is my go-to. Doing this every day helped me recover from general pains, and I do it whenever the pain flares up again.

- Whenever you feel pain, stop and adjust your posture. Oftentimes being locked in a specific position causes pain, so stop and analyze to see if any specific area causes a flareup. Oftentimes doing the *opposite* of that helps.

- A standing desk is nice for some variety in your posture, but this is more useful for traditional art/screen tablets. If you're using a screenless tablet, your neck posture is probably pretty good. Just adjust your monitor.

- I highly recommend taking up a hobby like birding or just plain ol' animal-watching as motivation for getting out there! Merlin by eBird is a fantastic app, and iNaturalist works for general animal stuff. These are like Pokedexes where you can upload pics of animals you see, and you can get near-immediate response from the app or community. It also helps you build a visual library for creatures, if that's what you're interested in.

# Making Money 

## Commissions
I've been doing commissions for 5 years and counting (at the point of writing this). I've also commissioned a lot of artists. It's not easy! But here are some pointers.

- **DON'T undercharge.** 
  - If you're just starting out and want experience, that's okay, do your $5 pieces. However...

  - If you're unsure and not confident, more often than not it's better to charge higher! (To a reasonable extent.)
    - Think about it this way; would you rather do **four $10 pieces** or **one $40 piece**?
    - If there's a request you find challenging, charge however much you feel comfortable being paid in order to do it. If it's several hundreds or thousands, so be it! (Though be responsible if that's something you don't think you can commit to.)

  - It's understandable not wanting to price out poorer folks, but cheaper commissions lead to stingier and more nitpicky clients. Instead, if you want to offer a flexible price range, you can adjust your scope. (e.g. for a rough sketch, you can still charge cheaply, and firmly set your boundaries of how much work will be delivered!)

- **Communicate, communicate, communicate!**
  - It is NOT a sign of vulnerability or weakness to admit you're struggling to deliver, whether it be life stuff or just general difficulty.
  - Most clients will be willing to work with you on that!

- Set **clear boundaries** and have a good **Terms of Service or contract** to protect yourself.
  - Communication is important, boundaries moreso. Don't let clients overwork you! It's best to establish boundaries at the start, but you reserve the right to remind clients if they start asking for more. 
  - Having a good ToS helps. It acts as a concrete set of rules for your client and your own reference.
    - My [Terms of Service](https://heckingsne.cc/#/commissions?tab=gen) is available for reference, if you'd like something thorough. Just note the CC license.

  - **EVEN IF A COMPANY APPROACHES YOU**, it's very important to draft up a clear contract. *No matter* how big they are. There are many incidents reported by artists, though I'd prefer not to put unnecessary attention on them so I won't link their stories here.
    - Companies can have a lot of bureaucracy. Expect to follow up with them, often. Sometimes you may have to take the initiative.
    - Some common things to note are turnaround time, usage rights (can you put the art on your portfolio? sell it as a print?), and payment method. (Always do 50/50 at the minimum, even for a big company.)

## Manufacturing and Manufacturers
Stickers, acrylic charms, etc. For people who want to do boothing!

Since most manufacturers are located in China, and a lot of Artist Alley resources out there are for Americans, this will be more of a Chinese-centric resource that assumes you know how to speak Chinese and want to go the extra mile. Which isn't a huge crowd, but hey, shout-out to my fellow EN/CN speakers.

- [Chinese Manufacturer Group Order Spreadsheet](https://docs.qq.com/sheet/DUFNsa09zRkRrQmZP?tab=BB08J2)
  - Most of these are QQ groups and require you to be able to read Chinese!

---
These are the manufacturers that worked **for me**. Quality may also vary down the road and it's never quite certain or stable with these manufacturers, so use at your own risk!

Taobao tends to be a little cheaper (and requires you to communicate in Chinese), but some can only be found on Alibaba (English/Paypal allowed)!

**DO NOT** trust reviews, especially if the photos look a little sterile and taken from a factory (you can usually tell from crusty quality, gloves, boring bg). Sometimes they are paid for and they give you the exact script to say.

If you can speak Chinese, Xiaohongshu and Weibo also have hobbyists sharing their experiences under the tag #做谷.

Oftentimes you can find a group order hosted by QQ, which will usually be advertised as an invite code (so if you see a confusing string of numbers, that's probably what it is.)

Some shorthands/slang:

- QQ 
  - 🐧 (penguin mascot)
- Taobao 
  - 🍑 (peach = tao, as in taobao)
  - tb
- XHS 
  - 🍠 (sweet potato = hongshu, pun with xiaohongshu)
  - 🍅 (sometimes called xihongshi, which sounds like xiaohongshu)
- Weidian (Weixin store)
  - vd

If you're a Taobao-er, you can probably find a manufacturer for ANYTHING by tacking on "-定制" onto the end.

### Fancy Clasps
Some of the QQ clasps are also resold on Taobao, though the stock may be less/marked up. Still, it's convenient if you don't want to DM the owner for an order...

Search term: 异形扣

- Jackpot造物所
  - Can be bought straight from Taobao!
- 草有的是
  - QQ: 712251399
- 时之砂扣子 
  - QQ: 916182709

### Worked well (for me)
#### Acrylic Charms

Search term: 亚克力挂件

- Juno Creative/朱诺创意 (Taobao/Alibaba)
  - Very middle of the road manufacturer. Not the worst, decent quality/vibrancy.
  - Just don't do their metal foil charms without epoxy, they're unprotected.

- [Bemick/Wenzhou Yadian](https://yadiancraft.en.alibaba.com/index.html?spm=a2700.details.0.0.6a9276b4l1o2vD&from=detail&productId=1601214118688) (Alibaba)
  - High quality manufacturer, offers a variety of services. Bit pricy, though...
  - Customer service is amazing however :)

- 心林亚克力制品店 (Taobao)
  - My GOATS!! Quality is amazing, and they do wing flapping charms, as well as tail wagging charms if you ask.
  - They do normal acrylic stuff too.

- Doujin Studio/豆角 Studio (Taobao) 
  - Quality is eh, basically the Vograce of Taobao. But the customer service is nice (when they're not on AI mode during off-hours) and they have a good variety.
  - Markup for every initial sample though, but still cheap because it's Taobao

#### Transfer Stickers
Search term: 转印贴

 - 广州水晶标转印贴广家 (Taobao)
   - Basically professional quality, super crisp prints. Around the quality you'd see for those liquid charms (those can be assembled on your own with the shell + oil + transfer stickers!)
   - Speaking of liquid charms, they're called 入油亚克力钥匙扣. Should be able to find the shell from there

#### Prints
- 沉默 stores (Taobao)
  - They tend to start with that in their names...basically the same service even if different listings and storefronts lol
  - Very nice 3D emboss look! Affordable, too

#### Plushies

Search term: 玩偶，公仔

- Xuzhou Gaopeng Toys (Alibaba)
  - They mostly specialize in MOQ 1 samples, which is great for hobbyists who want a plushie of their blorbo... 
  - The huge caveat is that the wait times are SUPER long, especially if you're doing a cheap 1 sample order. 
  - Also you're permitted up to three revisions but the first one will always look kind of garbo, and you have to re-pay the entire sample fee if you want more (~$300)

#### Custom Mousepads
Search term: 鼠标垫

Yes, including the tiddy ones. MOQ 1 so you can get one for yourself for like 15 bucks max.

- 锘雅数码专营店 (Taobao)

### AVOID
- Vograce.
  - They're a bit of a noob trap. Vograce mainly acts as a middleman with a convenient UI. 
  - Some things they offer for higher MOQs can be bought for MOQ 1 (like acrylic charms)! It doesn't cost extra to print on both sides!
- Wechat-only manufacturers (coins, PVC rubber charms, etc)
  - I've worked with a few, and they do eventually deliver, but most of the time they tend to be for higher MOQ products and get snippy with you if you live outside China (which you probably do if you're reading this)
  - They're just not used to non-Chinese addresses, even if you use an official Taobao proxy (even the default Cainiao address)
- 星冰乐亚克力 (Taobao)
  - Good lord they are bad. Me and a friend both ordered and the orders were botched (charm dimensions, printing mirrored, etc). Avoid

(TODO: Terminology translations)

# Contact

## Regarding Distribution of Resources
I believe in sharing knowledge, but I don't want this to be a repository for piracy. I've tried to provide as many free links (via archive.org) as I can, but some resources are paid, and I'd rather you support the artists.

Still, if you can't afford them (for one reason or the other), you can reach out to me. Send me examples of your art (SFW only please), which resources you want, why you want them, and I'll see what I can do. This is subject to my own judgment and I reserve the right to say no.

### Contact
My contact can be found on my [portfolio site](https://heckingsne.cc/#/gallery?page=1). Please use Bluesky DMs for informal communication, if possible. 

Feel free to suggest resources. However, I tend to vet my resources for effectiveness before suggesting them (and I have quite a backlog of art textbooks), so they may not go live on the site immediately, or at all.

### Special Thanks
- All the artists who offered up their resources, whom I've sourced and credited here. (Please contact me if you'd like anything taken down!)
- My fellow art study buddy, [Nisnow](https://nisnow.art/) (check out their art!)
- Chuji 🍉 for beta reading
